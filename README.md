# P0: GroupMe Bot

## Overview

- create a GroupMe bot that will be able to read/respond to messages in a GroupMe chat

## Pre-Requisites

- `python3` installed
  - see [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for download
- GroupMe:
  - account, sign up [here](https://groupme.com/en-US/register)
  - bot, see how to create one [here](https://dev.groupme.com/tutorials/bots)
    - you'll need an access token, it's basically just top right of the dev page
  - class GroupMe, join [here](https://groupme.com/join_group/98324520/GpX1Owv6)

## Setup

1. Fork te repo to your own account
    - go to the repo [here](https://github.com/cmsc389t-winter2024/p0.git)
    - click the fork button in the top right
    - ensure that when you fork, it is public, otherwise we won't be able to see your submission

```bash
# clone the forked repo to your local machine and cd into it 
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/p0.git && cd p0

# create virtual environment (this creates a folder called venv)
python3 -m venv venv

# activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # for mac/linux
venv\Scripts\activate # for windows

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tasks

We have provided you with an outline of the bot in [`bot.py`](./groupme-bot/bot.py) that is able to read/send messages to the GroupMe chat. Your task is to implement the following features:

- [ ] respond to you
  - you should be able to run your script and send a message in the GroupMe chat and have your bot respond to you and **only you**, meaning that if someone else sends the same message, **even with the same name**, your bot should not respond to them
    - hint: look at the [`sample.json`](./groupme-bot/sample.json) that shows what other fields you can extract from a response (i.e. `sender_id`)
    - you can view the contents of a response itself by printing `response.json().get("response", {})` located [here](./groupme-bot/bot.py#L31)(this is what is inside the `response` field of the `sample.json` file)
- [ ] good morning/good night
  - if *anyone* says good morning/good night, your bot should respond with a good morning/good night with their name
    - i.e. if someone says "good morning", your bot should respond with "good morning, <name>"
    - think about how you're going to stop your bot from responding to itself and the other bots in the chat
    - **caution:** if you start spamming the chat, please `ctrl+c` your script to stop it
    - feel free to mute the chat, we will use piazza for any important announcements
- [ ] create 1 (or more, for extra-credit) additional features that you think would be cool
  - you may incorporate other API's (i.e. [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#search))
  - you can have the bot perhaps have tell the weather of a particular city
- [ ] create a doc (markdown, `*.md` file) that outlines the features of your bot, how to run it
  - please put this file in the [`groupme-bot`](./groupme-bot) folder and name it `README.md`
  - refer to markdown syntax [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

## Running

```bash
# activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # for mac/linux
venv\Scripts\activate # for windows

# run bot
python3 bot.py
```

- you *may* additionally add flags that can be added to the `bot.py` script
  - i.e. `python3 bot.py --debug` should run the bot in debug mode and print out more information if something goes wrong
  - i.e. `python3 bot.py --help` should print out a help message that shows what flags are available
    - your TAs will appreciate this

## Submission

as you complete tasks, edit **this** markdown file to reflect your progress. if you have completed something just put an "x" in the checkbox. here's an example:

- [ ] respond to you (not done)
- [x] respond to you (done)

once you are done, commit your changes and push to your forked repo

```bash
# adds all files that have been changed in the current directory
git add .
# commit changes with message
git commit -m "completed p0"
# if this is your first time pushing, you'll need to set the upstream branch
git push --set-upstream origin main
# otherwise, you can just push
git push
```

then, on gradescope submit a `submission.txt` file that has the following contents:

```
username
repo
```

where `username` is your github username and `repo` is the name of your forked repo (i.e. `p0`)
